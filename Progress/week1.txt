- divide project into subprojects
- gather ideas for subprojects
- do we need an organizer? what do we demand from an organizer?
- what are strengths of each other? take previous experience into consideration
- content:
    - NAOMI or RDKIT
    - how shall the subprojects collaborate?
    - what are project objectives that we can realistically cover?
    - formulate milestones
    - formulate goals for the next meeting on 29.10

Targets of second meeting, 22.10:

    - Are we interested in a 2D- or 3D-depiction?
- Look at PLIP:
    - yields interaction tables (screenshot)
    - we can also set cut-offs for interactions (screenshots)
- What is it that we would like to add?

Finding interactions:
- water molecules can shield electrostatic interactions
- how do we consider that effect?
